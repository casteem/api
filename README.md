```

Then prepare your dev database:
```
PG_UNAME=steemhunt
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE USER $PG_UNAME;"
psql -d postgres -c "ALTER USER $PG_UNAME CREATEDB;"
psql -d postgres -c "ALTER USER $PG_UNAME WITH SUPERUSER;"
```

Then clone the api repo on 
`your_path/steemhunt/api`
and web repo on 
`your_path/steemhunt/web`

On api repo, install gems
```
gem install bundler
bundle install
